# HackerRank Test Runner

[HackerRank](https://www.hackerrank.com/) encourages you to write code in your
own editor.  They provide sample test cases for you to use.  They do _not_
provide an easy way for you to run process the data while you develop.

This is a test runner designed to help with this process, providing immediate
feedback while completing challenges.


## Usage

Assuming you've downloaded the test cases from HackerRank and exported the .zip
to `2d-array/tests`, you can test them with

```
hrtr 2d-array/solution.js 2d-array/tests
```

**hrtr** solution test-cases
